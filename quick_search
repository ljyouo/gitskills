In fact, Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its contents.

You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using:
$ git config --list --show-origin

Identity
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.
