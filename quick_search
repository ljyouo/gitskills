In fact, Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its contents.

configuration
$ git config --list --show-origin //You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using
$ git config --list  //Checking Your Settings 

Identity
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.

Editor //编辑器
$ git config --global core.editor editor_name_or_windows_path

Getting Help
$ git help <verb>         //eg. $git help config
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git-<verb>
quick refresher : -h
eg. $git add -h
